# IMAGE CAPTION GENERATOR- AI/ML with Natural Language Processing

This project showcases an advanced Image Caption Generator designed using AI and Machine Learning techniques with a strong emphasis on Natural Language Processing. The system is built to generate accurate, contextually relevant captions for images by seamlessly integrating image processing and language generation models.



## Authors

- [@Shresthi Singh](https://github.com/shresthisingh-exe)


## Features

- Image Processing: The system processes images to extract visual features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- Language Model: It uses a recurrent neural network (RNN), typically with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, to generate sentences that describe the image content.
- Training & Dataset: The system is trained on large datasets such as MS COCO, containing thousands of images with corresponding captions, to enhance accuracy and fluency in caption generation.
- Applications: This project has potential applications in areas such as accessibility for visually impaired individuals, content creation, and image indexing for search engines.
